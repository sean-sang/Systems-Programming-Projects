1. cd cs2600/assignment1/sys_logs ; grep "bluetooth" sys_logs > bt_logs

2. grep "ERROR" bt_logs > bt_error_logs

3. grep -w -m 1 -A 10 "[1-4]\.[0-5]" sys_logs > power_logs

4. It would appear that after the battery level hits critical at 5.0 > x, it will disable the bluetooth module entirely instead of entering a low power mode. Following this, different services will attempt to access the bluetooth module but find that it is not started and continue throwing errors.

I would hire a bunch of unpaid interns to fix the bug for me since I have no knowledge or interest in fixing the issue myself by enticing them with the offer of "job experience" and "resume building". With the unpaid interns, it would not effect the payroll and therefore would hopefully not put my job at risk in the next set of layoffs. In fact, I would take credit for my interns work and show the CEO that I was able to fix an issue that is effectively showing that I am capable of completing the tasks of the previous team and that I deserve a promotion.
